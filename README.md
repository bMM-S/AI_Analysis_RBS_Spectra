# AI for characterization of thin films using RBS

## LIP Summer Internship 23'

### Summary
For those interested in applying deep learning techniques to the field of materials science, an internship utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents an excellent opportunity. One of the methods employed for thin film characterization is Rutherford Back-scattering Spectrometry (RBS), a potent analytical tool that lies on the detection of back-scattered ions from a sample surface, enabling researchers to investigate material composition and properties. However, analyzing RBS data can be a laborious and time-consuming process. The use of AI models can automate this process and make it useful for experimental scenarios. Our group produces thin film targets at the evaporator facility, which are utilized for nuclear physics experiments worldwide. This internship will provide hands-on experience in designing and implementing AI models and, in addition, explore material analysis techniques. Upon completion, you will have developed essential skills and knowledge in the fields of materials science and machine learning, enabling you to contribute to cutting-edge research in this exciting area. We`re looking for a student from physics or engineering physics that really likes to program and enjoys hands-on work, it would be preferable if the student feels comfortable using Python!
